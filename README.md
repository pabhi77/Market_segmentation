Market Segmentation Analysis
This project focuses on performing a market segmentation analysis using customer perception data. The goal is to identify distinct consumer segments based on their attitudes toward a specific brand, in this case, McDonald's, and to analyze the demographics and behavior patterns associated with each segment.

Key Features:

Data Collection: The dataset includes consumer perceptions of various attributes such as "yummy," "convenient," "spicy," and demographic information like age, gender, and visit frequency.
Segmentation: K-Means clustering was used to divide the consumers into distinct segments based on their perceptions.
Visualization: Detailed visualizations are provided to understand the characteristics of each segment, focusing on age, gender, visit frequency, and overall sentiment toward the brand.
Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization
